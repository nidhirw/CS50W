# CS50W

The projects included in this repository are projects from Harvard University's Course: CS50W - Web Programming with Python and Javascript.
Each project had some outlined requirements and criteria that needed to be met. The execution to meet each criteria was left to the individual.

Each project has a README file that describes how to run and view each project.
