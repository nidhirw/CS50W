# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The project outline and requirements can be found here: https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/0/project0.html

I decided to create a web-page about some of my travels and the travel itineraries. 

Key things to note in this project:
- Responsive web-page - adjusts accordingly to the width of the browser interface
- Inclusion of Bootstrap components - in particular, the navigation feature and grid model
- Custom CSS stylesheets

To run this locally, navigate to the folder and in your terminal run the command: http-server -o index.html
